This can be done by selecting the "View Lab Results" button from the navigation menu after logging in using the 
login credentials listed above. The UI will then display a table with medical reports. If the user clicks on a row in
the table and then selects the "Add/Edit" button, the user can edit that Medical Report through the detail view that appears.
If the user does not select a row in the table and then selects the "Add/Edit" button, then the user can create a new Medical
Report through the detail view that appears. These changes will then be reflected in the table when the user transitions back
to the list view.
