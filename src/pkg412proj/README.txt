M03-A05 instructions for grader: The implemented use case for this assignment is "Add/Update Medical Records."
This can be done by selecting the "View Lab Results" button from the navigation menu after logging in using the 
login credentials listed above. The UI will then display a table with medical reports. If the user clicks on a row in
the table and then selects the "Add/Edit" button, the user can edit that Medical Report through the detail view that appears.
If the user does not select a row in the table and then selects the "Add/Edit" button, then the user can create a new Medical
Report through the detail view that appears. These changes will then be reflected in the table when the user transitions back
to the list view.
